# YouTube Downloader
* ✅ **Download videos** in the best quality (MP4)
* ✅ **Convert to MP3** (high definition audio)
* ✅ **Selecting a folder** to save
* ✅ **Quality Selector**: Added a new Video Quality dropdown menu (OptionMenu). You can now choose between 1080p, 720p, and 480p before starting your download.
* ✅ **System Tray Integration**: The app no longer closes instantly when you click the "X". It now minimizes to the system tray (near the clock). You can restore the window or exit the app entirely via the tray icon's context menu.
